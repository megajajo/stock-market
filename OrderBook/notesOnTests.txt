1. What happens if the orders are not feasible? For example, I try to sell stock that I don't have or
I try to buy stocks with balance that I don't have?


2. Might need a whole market if I test with multiple types of stocks, will implement this later in the week.


3. What happens when a client wants to buy from himself?

4. I want to organize all that is related to tests in a folder after I finish implementing everything
